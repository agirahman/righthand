# Verification

## When to use

- A change is ready to claim complete or fixed.
- Acceptance criteria must be proven, not asserted.

## Procedure

1. For each acceptance criterion, identify the exact command that proves it.
2. Run the exact command from the acceptance criteria; do not substitute an equivalent.
3. Record command, exit code, and trimmed output for every claim.
4. Treat "not run" as a distinct result from "passed"; report it as not run.
5. Re-run after any edit; stale output is not evidence.
6. For bug fixes, reproduce first, then verify the fix removes the symptom.
7. Report failures with the actual output, not a paraphrase.

## Checklist

- [ ] Every claim has command, exit code, and trimmed output.
- [ ] Commands match acceptance criteria exactly.
- [ ] No "passed" claim without a fresh run.
- [ ] "Not run" reported distinctly where applicable.
- [ ] Failures include actual output.

## Evidence

- The command list with exit codes and trimmed output.
- Report and board entries recording the results.

## Notes

- "Not run" is a valid result and must be stated as such.
- Trim output to the relevant lines; do not paste megabytes.
- Store evidence in the report, not only in terminal scrollback.
